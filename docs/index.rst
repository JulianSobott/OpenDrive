Welcome to OpenDrive's documentation!
=====================================

OpenDrive is an open source, self hosting alternative to Google Drive. You need an own server, that you have access to.
For me a Raspberry-pi 3 with an external hard-drive just went fine.

Features
--------

- Automatically sync your files between multiple devices
- Define which file/folders to sync
- No third parties have access to your data
- Share your files and make them available for other people
- Access your files from everywhere, where you have internet access
