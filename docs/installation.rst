Installation
=============

This page will show you how to install and setup OpenDrive on a server and a client. A client is any pc. We will start
with the server.

Server setup
------------

On the server you need python 3 to be installed. You also need access to the servers commandline. Either directly or
via ssh.

First we install OpenDrive.

The easiest way is to use `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/>`_:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install open-drive

.. warning::

    The pip installation is currently not available, but will be added soon. For now you have to clone it from Github.

It is also possible to clone the repository from `Github <https://github.com/JulianSobott/OpenDrive>`_:

.. code-block:: console

   git clone https://github.com/JulianSobott/OpenDrive.git

.. todo::

    Add setup of the server. Either over the console or from external from a website.
