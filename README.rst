OpenDrive
===========

OpenDrive is an open source, self hosting file synchronization service. You need an own server, that you have access to.
For me a Raspberry-pi 3 with an external hard-drive just went fine.

Features
--------

- Automatically sync your files between multiple devices
- Define which file/folders to sync
- No third parties have access to your data
- Share your files and make them available for other people
- Access your files from everywhere, where you have internet access

Installation
--------------

Currently the only way to install it, is by cloning the repository and installing all the requirements. But we are
working on a more user friendly way.

A complete installation guide can be found at the
`official documentation <https://opendrive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_.
