OpenDrive
===========

OpenDrive is an open source, self hosting file synchronization service. You need an own server, that you have access to.
For me a Raspberry-pi 3 with an external hard-drive just went fine.

Current State of the project
----------------------------

I'm currently no longer working on this project and this project is not production ready.
It was possible to synchronize files between devices, when they changed or when the synchronization was setup.
However there is no real error handling. The code was devoloped, while I had very little knowledge about clean code. 
Also I had nearly no knowledege about synchronization software.

However everyone who is interested, is welcome to fork this repo, make pull requests or create issues.

Features
--------

- Automatically sync your files between multiple devices
- Define which file/folders to sync
- No third parties have access to your data

- Access your files from everywhere, where you have internet access

Installation
--------------

Currently the only way to install it, is by cloning the repository and installing all the requirements. But we are
working on a more user friendly way.
